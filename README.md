# TCWT: Temporal Curvature Wave Theory

**Scalar-tensor K-essence model where time is a coherent oscillation behaving as dark matter.**

## Project Overview
This repository contains the numerical implementation and diagnostic tools for the Temporal Curvature Wave Theory, built upon the hi_class/CLASS framework.

### Directory Contents
- **/project_contents**: Contains all core code, including:
  - `configs/`: Selection of `.ini` files (e.g., `tcwt_stabilized_squeeze.ini`).
  - `plots/`: Key result images and visualizations.
  - `scripts/`: Over 70 diagnostic tools (e.g., `plot_tcwt.py`).

## Quick Start
To run a diagnostic script from the root:
```bash
python3 project_contents/scripts/plot_tcwt.py

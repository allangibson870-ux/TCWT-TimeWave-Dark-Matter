# Temporal Curvature Wave Theory (TCWT)

🌀 The Concept: What is Temporal Curvature Wave Theory (TCWT)?
Standard General Relativity treats time as a static, passive dimension in the 4D fabric of spacetime. TCWT proposes a fundamental shift: Time is a dynamic, physical field (the "TimeWave") that possesses its own tension, mass, and curvature.
Core Principles:
Temporal Mass (
): High-significance events and high-density matter act as "temporal anchors," creating gradients in the flow of time itself.
The TimeWave (
): Instead of a smooth linear progression, time propagates as a wave through a higher-dimensional manifold. Gravity is not just the curvature of space, but the refraction of matter moving through this shifting temporal gradient.
The Goldilocks Coupling (0.1834): Our research identifies a specific "tension" in the TimeWave where the theory perfectly mimics General Relativity at large scales while providing a 25% growth boost in the mid-universe (
).
Why it Matters:
This theory provides a potential mathematical solution to the "JWST Problem"—the observation of massive galaxies in the early universe that shouldn't exist according to standard models. By "supercharging" early gravity through temporal resonance, TCWT allows structure to form faster without breaking the laws of physics we see today.

**Model Verification: The 0.18 Goldilocks Coupling**

This repository contains the numerical implementation and cosmological verification of the **Temporal Curvature Wave Theory (TCWT)**, built on the `hi_class` (Horndeski in CLASS) engine.

## 🚀 Key Discovery: The Goldilocks Zone
Our simulations have identified a unique coupling constant of **0.1834** that bridges the gap between standard General Relativity and early-universe growth anomalies.

### Observational Signature: Euclid Residual Test
The plot below demonstrates that at a coupling of **0.20**, the TCWT model remains mathematically stable and effectively "indistinguishable" from standard Einstein gravity within the 1% precision limit of the **ESA Euclid Satellite**.

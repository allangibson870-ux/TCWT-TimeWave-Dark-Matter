# TCWT Theory Overview  
### Temporal Curvature Wave Theory (TCWT)

TCWT is a scalar–tensor cosmological framework in which a single scalar field  
\(\phi\) generates a “TimeWave” that acts as both:

- an ultra-light dark matter component, and  
- a modifier of the growth of structure through additional friction terms.

The model is constructed within the **DHOST Class I** family of scalar–tensor theories,  
the only branch that remains compatible with the GW170817 constraint on the speed of gravity.

## 1. Action and Field Content

The TCWT action is schematically:

\[
S = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g}
\left[
\frac{M_{\rm Pl}^2}{2}R
+ G_2(\phi,X)
+ G_3(\phi,X)\Box\phi
+ G_4(\phi,X)R
+ \mathcal{L}_{\rm matter}
\right]
\]

where:

- \(X = -\frac{1}{2}(\partial\phi)^2\) is the kinetic term  
- \(G_2\) provides the dark-matter-like behaviour  
- \(G_3\) introduces Vainshtein screening  
- \(G_4\) encodes conformal/disformal couplings to gravity  

The TimeWave interpretation is conceptual: \(\phi\) defines an effective time structure whose oscillations behave as dark matter.

## 2. Dark Matter Behaviour

For an ultra-light mass scale:

\[
m_\phi \sim 10^{-22}\,\text{eV},
\]

the scalar field oscillates rapidly and averages to a pressureless component on cosmological timescales.  
This reproduces fuzzy-DM-like phenomenology while allowing additional structure-modifying effects.

## 3. Linear Perturbations and Growth Suppression

The matter density contrast obeys:

\[
\ddot{\delta} + (2H + \gamma)\dot{\delta}
- 4\pi G_{\rm eff}\rho\,\delta = 0,
\]

where:

- \(\gamma\) is an extra friction term sourced by the TimeWave field  
- \(G_{\rm eff}\) is an effective gravitational coupling  

A suppression of the growth factor by 5–10% (required
